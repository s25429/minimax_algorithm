## General Information
- It is a simple made-by-me minimax algorithm fitted into a game of tic-tac-toe.
- It is written in Python and does not use any libraries that need to be installed via pip.
- Idea was to try writing more of a real algorithm, seeing how well I can do. It seems to work rather well and through my testing I have not noticed any issues.
- Although it seems to work well, other algorithms seem to win a game of tic-tac-toe more often. My algorithm might be under-performing, but not sure on that.
- It currently does not use alpha-beta prunning.

## Technologies used
- Python 3.7+

## Setup
Simply copy the repository and run it with at least Python 3.7. It uses dataclasses, which after version 3.7 were added as a built-in library to python. 
Nothing else is needed.

## Usage
- After launch you will be prompted to choose players. Your options are HUMAN, AI-EASY and AI-HARD. AI-EASY chooses spots at random. AI-HARD uses the algorithm.
- Next you will be asked to choose algorithm search depth if you had chosed hard ai. Usually numbers between 6 and 10 work best.
- After that you will be able to play! Simply type in the number of your preferred cell when prompted and get ready to be squashed by the AI! Or vice versa.

## Project Status
Project is complete, but might receive update if I will feel like improving on it.

## Room for Improvement
- Alpha-beta prunning
- Optimizing the code itself more
- Some GUI? Would require an external library.
